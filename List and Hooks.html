            <p><b>Ans.</b>
            <b>life cycle in class component  with hooks</b><br>:

            React lifecycle methods in class components and their implementation in React Hooks. In React, each component has stages during its lifecycle, generally referred to as React component's lifecycle. There are different phases in the lifecycle, viz. Mounting, Updating, and Unmounting.


            <b>life cycle in functional component with hooks </b><br>:

            A React component undergoes three phases in its lifecycle: mounting, updating, and unmounting. The mounting phase is when a new component is created and inserted into the DOM or, in other words, when the life of a component begins. This can only happen once, and is often called â€œinitial render.
